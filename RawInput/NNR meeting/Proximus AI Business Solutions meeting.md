Topics discussed in AI Business Solutions meeting (Modern Workplace,Power Platform) for Proximus

Topics:
Copilot Wall-to-Wall Deal Strategy for Proximus: 
Olivia, Sigi, Dmitry, and Patrick discussed the strategy for proposing a wall-to-wall M365 Copilot deal to Proximus, including commercial modeling, adoption support, partner involvement, and funding mechanisms, with Olivia presenting an economic simulation and outlining next steps for internal and customer engagement.
	Current License Status and Adoption Approach: Olivia explained that Proximus currently has 3,500 M365 Copilot licenses out of a potential 17,000 E5 users, with a phased adoption approach using waiting lists and waves of 750 licenses every six months; the team aims to propose a shift to a 10,000 license wall-to-wall model to accelerate adoption.
	Economic Simulation and Funding Proposal: Olivia shared an Excel-based simulation comparing the costs of phased versus wall-to-wall licensing, showing that while the wall-to-wall approach is more expensive in the early years, it becomes more cost-effective over five years; she proposed seeking ESIF funding to cover the initial higher costs, referencing a similar successful case with ABI.
	Partner and Service Elements: The team discussed the need for refreshed training materials, communication campaigns, and adoption activities, suggesting that Proximus Next and Unified collaborate on a comprehensive adoption support proposal, with input from Proximus Sr. to tailor the offering.
	Internal and Customer Engagement Plan: Sigi and Olivia outlined a two-step engagement: first, gathering feedback from Proximus Sr. on previous Proximus Next sessions, and second, presenting the proposal to leadership, including leveraging the ASIF funding as an incentive and ensuring buy-in from key stakeholders such as the CEO and CDIO.
	CSU and Microsoft Involvement: The group agreed to maximize CSU's role in providing additional adoption and value realization services, with Dmitry tasked to check with Inge and Evert about available workshops and support, and Olivia planning to approach Johanna and Steven for deal desk approval.
Proximus Global Engagement and AI Awareness: 
Olivia, Sigi, and Dmitry reviewed recent efforts to increase AI and Copilot awareness within Proximus Global, discussed organizational challenges, and planned further engagement with key contacts to expand Copilot and agent adoption.
	AI Awareness Session and Feedback: Olivia described a recent session delivered to Proximus Global's VP Business Operations team, noting low awareness of AI and Copilot capabilities and identifying a need for further enablement and outreach.
	Organizational Contacts and Next Steps: The team identified key contacts, including Talia and Dave Van Hill, and agreed that Olivia would seek an introduction to Dave to explore further opportunities for Copilot and agent adoption within Proximus Global.
	Technical Issue Resolution: Dmitry reported that a Google Calendar integration issue had been resolved by clearing cache, which Sigi noted was critical for keeping Dave open to further discussions about Microsoft solutions.
	Strategic Alignment and Meeting Planning: Sigi and Olivia planned to include Proximus Global in broader Copilot strategy discussions, with Olivia agreeing to join an upcoming global monthly meeting to present recent activities and explore further collaboration.
Governance, Security, and Agentic AI Considerations: 
Patrick, Olivia, and Sigi discussed governance controls for Copilot and agentic AI, the separation of Copilot and agentic AI strategies, and upcoming sessions focused on security and solution guidance for Proximus.
	Governance and Controls for Agents: Patrick and Olivia confirmed that governance controls are available for Copilot Studio agents, while agent builder agents are currently blocked to prevent uncontrolled usage and cost escalation, addressing customer concerns about risk and consumption.
	Separation of Copilot and Agentic AI Strategies: Sigi advised against combining Copilot and agentic AI in customer proposals due to differing timelines and complexity, recommending a focused approach for Copilot while keeping agentic AI as a separate track unless the customer requests integration.
	Upcoming Security and Solution Guidance Sessions: Patrick outlined plans for follow-up sessions with Proximus, including a deep dive on low code versus pro code solutions and a security-focused session with support from Benoit, GBB, and Manon, with further sessions to be scheduled based on customer feedback.
Windows 365 Rollout and Support Coordination: 
Olivia, Sigi, and Dmitry coordinated next steps for the Windows 365 rollout at Proximus, including team changes, support from FastTrack and CSU, and additional opportunities for developer and call center adoption.
	Team Changes and Sync Planning: Olivia noted recent team changes at Proximus, with Maxim and Jurgen leaving, and planned to coordinate with Daniel for ongoing syncs and support.
	Support Structure for Rollout: Olivia confirmed that FastTrack architects would provide primary support for the Windows 365 rollout, with CSU and Stephanie available for additional assistance if needed.
	Developer and Call Center Opportunities: Sigi and Olivia discussed the successful adoption of Windows 365 by the developer community and the potential for future expansion to call centers, recommending a focus on ensuring a successful initial rollout before scaling further.
Pipeline, Targets, and Bi-Weekly Coordination: 
Olivia, Sigi, and Patrick reviewed pipeline status, quota versus pipeline targets, and bi-weekly coordination practices, emphasizing the need to monitor M365 Copilot adoption metrics and maintain up-to-date tracking for ongoing and future quarters.
	Quota and Pipeline Review: Olivia presented current pipeline and quota figures, noting that the team is ahead of target for the current quarter but highlighting the need to increase M365 Copilot chat adoption to meet steeply rising targets in future quarters.
	Tracking and Coordination Tools: Olivia described the use of a Loop page for bi-weekly notes and pipeline tracking, with plans to update and maintain a task list and workload updates for team accountability.
